# PlacementDrive
Final project of Ed Spread

Placement Drive is a portal that consolidates company eligibility, ongoing placement updates, and status and displays previous year placement statistics. Students can log in to their dashboard and keep track of upcoming interviews, and submitted applications, and view company-wise eligibility. Admins upload upcoming placement drives, company eligibility, control applications, and student databases.
